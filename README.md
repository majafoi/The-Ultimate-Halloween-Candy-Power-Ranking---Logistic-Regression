I have used this dataset to create a logistic regression, and to calculate probabilities that a candy is indeed a chocolate one, based on the variables below. I have changed the values of all variables to numeric, in order to proceed with the logistic regression. 

Variable names and description are as it follows:

- chocolate: Does it contain chocolate?
- fruity: Is it fruit flavored?
- caramel: Is there caramel in the candy?
- peanutalmondy: Does it contain peanuts, peanut butter or almonds?
- nougat: Does it contain nougat?
- crispedricewafer: Does it contain crisped rice, wafers, or a cookie component?
- hard: Is it a hard candy?
- bar: Is it a candy bar?
- pluribus: Is it one of many candies in a bag or box?
- sugarpercent: The percentile of sugar it falls under within the data set.
- pricepercent: The unit price percentile compared to the rest of the set.
- winpercent: The overall win percentage according to 269,000 matchups.
